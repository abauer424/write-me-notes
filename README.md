# Write Me Notes

## Description 

For this assignment, our task was to create that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses Express.js for the backend and saves and retrieves note data from the JSON file.

Since the applications front end was provided in the starter code, my job was to build the backend and connect it with the front end and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
